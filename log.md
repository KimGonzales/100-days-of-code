# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## INTENTION
I've decided to take this challenge as a recent graduate of the Flatiron School's
Full Stack Web Development program. My aim is to develop my programming skills - specifically my knowledge of Ruby, Javascript, SQL and Algorithms. 


### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)
